<h2>Impact of percentage in school on Salary</h2>

In above [school_percentage.ipynb](https://github.com/SatvikVirmani/engineering-graduate-salary-analysis/blob/main/individual_impacts/school_percentage/school_percentage.ipynb), I analysed the relation between student's **percentage in school** and Salary

### Conclusion of the analysis

1. Trend of Salary with 12 percentage is linear with positive slope

2. More the percentage in 12 class better is the probabilty of getting higher packages

3. Majority of students scored averagely between 60% to 85% in 12 boards

4. Majority of students scored approximately equal percentage in 12 class as they did in 10 class

5. There is high relation between 12 percentage and 10 percentage (more percentage in 10 suggests more percentage in 12)
